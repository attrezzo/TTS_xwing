This is a project aiming to get the X-Wing minitures game playable and enjoyable as a custom mod on the Tabletop Simulator game.

Tabletop Simulator on Steam:

To try out this mod, you can download and unzip the last release from here and place it in Documents -> My Games -> Tabletop SImulator -> Saves folder, then just load it up in game.

Altenatively, here's the workshop item that *should* contain last release of the table:
